-
-        \brief The QtSvg module provides classes for displaying and creating SVG files.
-
-        To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the
-        following directive:
-
-        \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_qtsvg.cpp 0
-
-        To link against the module, add this line to your \l qmake \c
-        .pro file:
-
-        \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_qtsvg.pro 1
-
-        \section1 Rendering SVG files
-
-        Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a language for describing two-dimensional
-        graphics and graphical applications in XML. SVG 1.1 is a W3C Recommendation
-        and forms the core of the current SVG developments in Qt. SVG 1.2 is the
-        specification currently being developed by the \l{SVG Working Group}, and it
-        is \l{http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG12/}{available in draft form}.
-        The \l{Mobile SVG Profiles} (SVG Basic and SVG Tiny) are aimed at
-        resource-limited devices and are part of the 3GPP platform for third generation
-        mobile phones. You can read more about SVG at \l{About SVG}.
-
-        Qt supports the \l{SVG 1.2 Tiny Static Features}{static features} of
-        \l{SVG 1.2 Tiny}. ECMA scripts and DOM manipulation are currently not
-        supported.
-
-        SVG drawings can be rendered onto any QPaintDevice subclass. This
-            approach gives developers the flexibility to experiment, in order
-        to find the best solution for each application.
-
-        The easiest way to render SVG files is to construct a QSvgWidget and
-        load an SVG file using one of the QSvgWidget::load() functions.
-
-        QSvgRenderer is the class responsible for rendering SVG files for
-        QSvgWidget, and it can be used directly to provide SVG support for
-        custom widgets.
-        To load an SVG file, construct a QSvgRenderer with a file name or the
-        contents of a file, or call QSvgRenderer::load() on an existing
-        renderer. If the SVG file has been loaded successfully the
-        QSvgRenderer::isValid() will return true.
-
-        Once you have loaded the SVG file successfully, you can render it
-            with the QSvgRenderer::render() function. Note that this scheme allows
-        you to render SVG files on all paint devices supported by Qt, including
-        QWidget, QGLWidget, and QImage. See the \l{SVG Viewer Example}{SVG Viewer}
-        example for more details.
