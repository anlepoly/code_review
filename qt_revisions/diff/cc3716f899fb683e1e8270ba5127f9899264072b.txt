     \brief The Sprite element represents a sprite animation
 
+    QQuickSprite renders sprites of one or more frames and animates them. The sprites
+    can be in the middle of an image file, or split along multiple rows, as long as they form
+    a contiguous line wrapping to the next row of the file from the left edge of the file.
+
+    Sprites within one animation must be the same size, however sprites within the same file
+    do not. Sprites without a frameCount specified assume that they take the entire file.
+
+    There are several software tools to help turn images into sprite sheets, here are some examples:
+    Photoshop plugin:

+    Gimp plugin:
+    http://registry.gimp.org/node/20943
+    Cmd-line tool:
