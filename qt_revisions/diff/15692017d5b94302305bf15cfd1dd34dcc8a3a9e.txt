+    Be aware that QQmlParserStatus methods are only called when a class is instantiated
+    by a QQmlEngine. If you create the same class directly from C++, these methods will
+    not be called automatically. To avoid this problem, it is recommended that you start
+    deferring operations from classBegin instead of from the initial creation of your class.
+    This will still prevent multiple revaluations during initial binding assignment in QML,
+    but will not defer operations invoked from C++.

     To use QQmlParserStatus, you must inherit both a QObject-derived class
     and QQmlParserStatus, and use the Q_INTERFACES() macro.
