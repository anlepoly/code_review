     QStateMachine is based on the concepts and notation of
-    \l{Statecharts: A visual formalism for complex
-    systems}{Statecharts}. QStateMachine is part of \l{The State
-    Machine Framework}.

+    QStateMachine is part of \l{The State Machine Framework}.
 
     A state machine manages a set of states (classes that inherit from
     QAbstractState) and transitions (descendants of
     QAbstractTransition) between those states; these states and
     transitions define a state graph. Once a state graph has been
     built, the state machine can execute it. QStateMachine's
-    execution algorithm is based on the \l{State Chart XML: State
-    Machine Notation for Control Abstraction}{State Chart XML (SCXML)}
+    execution algorithm is based on the \l{http://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/}{State Chart XML (SCXML)}
     algorithm. The framework's \l{The State Machine
     Framework}{overview} gives several state graphs and the code to
     build them.
