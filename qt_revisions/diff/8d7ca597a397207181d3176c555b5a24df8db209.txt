+        [Qt] QWebView uses the mobile style and doesn't follow Qt's style
+        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104134
+
+        Reviewed by Simon Hausmann.
+
+        Another issue introduced by r136235.
+        Fix the order of initialization of the styleFactory and creation of the
+        WebCore Page. Since the latter has a RenderTheme member and the creation
+        of the appropriate RenderTheme type (QStyle-backed) is dependant on having
+        first initialized the theme factory function, we need to postpone this just
+        a little bit.
+
+        * WebCoreSupport/QWebPageAdapter.cpp:
+        (QWebPageAdapter::QWebPageAdapter):
+        (QWebPageAdapter::initializeWebCorePage): Added.
+        * WebCoreSupport/QWebPageAdapter.h:
+        * WidgetApi/qwebpage.cpp:
+        (QWebPagePrivate::QWebPagePrivate): call initializeWebCorePage only after
+        having initialized WebKitWidgets related logic (QStyle hooks in this case).
