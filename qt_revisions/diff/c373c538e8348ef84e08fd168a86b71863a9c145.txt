-    This enum represents the options that can be set on a socket.
-    If desired, they can be set after having received the connected() signal from

-    \value LowDelayOption Try to optimize the socket for low latency. For a QTcpSocket
-    this would set the TCP_NODELAY option and disable Nagle's algorithm. Set this to 1
-    to enable.
-    \value KeepAliveOption Set this to 1 to enable the SO_KEEPALIVE socket option
