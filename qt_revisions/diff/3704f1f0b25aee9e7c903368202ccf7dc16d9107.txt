 \title Usecase - Animations In QML
 \brief Example of how to include animations in QML applications
+
+QtQuick provides the ability to animate properties. Animating properties allows property values to move through
+intermediate values instead of immediately changing to the target value. To animate the position of an item, you can
+animate the properties that controle the item's position, x and y for example, so that the item's position 
+changes each frame on the way to the target position.
+
+\section1 Fluid UIs
+
+QML was designed to facilitate the creation of fluid UIs. These are user interfaces where the UI elements animate when
+they move instead of elements appearing, disappearing, or jumping. Qt Quick provides two simple ways to have UI
+elements move with animation instead of instantly appearing at their new location.
+
+\section2 States and Transitions
+
+QtQuick allows you to declare various UI states in \l State objects. These states are comprised of property changes from a
+base state, and can be a useful way of organizing your UI logic. Transitions are objects you can associate with an item
+to define how its properties will animate when they change due to a state change.
+
+States and transitions for an item can be declared with the \l Item::states and \l Item::transitions properties.
+States are declared inside the states list property of an item, usually the root item of the component. Transitions
+defined on the same item are used to animate the changes in the state. Here is an example.
+
+\snippet qml/usecases/animations.qml states
+
+\section2 Animating Property Changes.
+
+Behaviors can be used to specify an animation for a property to use when it changes. This is then applied to all
+changes, regardless of their source. The following example animates a button moving around the
+screen using behaviors.
+
+\snippet qml/usecases/animations.qml behave
+
+\section1 Other Animations
+
+Not all animations have to be tied to a specific property or state. You can also create animations more generally, and
+specify target items and properties inside the animation. Here are some examples of different ways to do this:
+
+\snippet qml/usecases/animations.qml constant
+\snippet qml/usecases/animations.qml scripted
+\image qml-uses-animation.png
+
+More information about animations can be found on the \l{Important Concepts in Qt Quick - States, Transitions and
+Animations} page.

-\title Use Case - Integrating JavaScript In QML
+\title Use Case - Integrating JavaScript in QML
 \brief Example of how to integrate JavaScript code in QML applications
+
+JavaScript code can be easily integrated into QML to provide UI logic, imperative control, or other benefits.
+
+\section1 Using JavaScript Expressions for Property Values
+
+JavaScript expressions can be used in QML as bindings. For example
+\code
+Item {
+    width: Math.random()
+    height: width < 100 ? 100 : (width + 50) /  2
+}
+\endcode
+
+Note that function calls, like Math.random(), will not be revaluated unless their arguments
+change. So binding to Math.random() will be one random number and not revaluated, but if the width is changed in some
+other manner, the height binding will be reevaluated to take that into account.
+
+\section1 Adding JavaScript Functions in QML
+
+JavaScript functions can be declared on QML items, like in the below example. This allows you to call the method
+using the item id.
+
+\snippet qml/usecases/integratingjs-inline.qml 0
+
+\section1 Using JavaScript files
+
+JavaScript files can be used for abstracting out logic from QML files. To do this, first place your functions inside a
+.js file like in the example shown.
+
+\snippet qml/usecases/myscript.js 0
+
+Then import the file into any .qml file that needs to use the functions, like the example QML file below.
+
+\snippet qml/usecases/integratingjs.qml 0
+
+\image qml-uses-integratingjs.png
+
+For further details on the JavaScript engine used by QML, as well as the difference from browser JS, see the full
+documentation on \c {Using JavaScript Expressions with QML}.

 \title Use Case - Layouts In QML
 \brief Example of how to create layouts for visual elements in a QML application
+
+There are several ways to position items in QML, including simple property bindings.
+
+\section1 Manual Positioning
+
+Items can be placed at specific x,y coordinates on the screen by setting their x,y properties. This will setup their
+position relative to the top left corner of their parent, for more detail see \c {Visual Canvas}.
+
+Combined with using bindings instead of constant valudes for these properties, relative positioning is also easily
+accomplished by setting the x and y coordinates to the appropriate bindings.
+
+\snippet qml/usecases/layouts.qml direct
+
+\section1 Anchors
+
+The \c Item type provides the abilitiy to anchor to other Item types. There are six anchor lines for each item: left,
+right, vertical center, top, bottom and horizontal center. The three vertical anchor lines can be anchored to any of
+the three vertical anchor lines of another item, and the three horizontal anchor lines can be anchored to the
+horizontal anchor lines of another item.
+
+For full details, see the documentation of the \l{Item::anchors}{anchors property}.
+
+\snippet qml/usecases/layouts.qml anchors
+
+\section1 Positioners
+
+For the common case of wanting to position a set of elements in a regular pattern, QtQuick provides some Positioner
+types. Items placed in a positioner are automatically positioned in some way, for example a Row positions items to be
+horizontally adjacent (forming a row).
+
+For full details see the documentation for \l{qtquick-qmltypereference.html#positioning}{the positioner types}.

 \title Use Case - Style And Theme Support
-\brief Example of how to style user-interface elements in QML
+\brief Example of how to style user interface elements in QML
+
+The types provided in the QtQuick module are not complete user interface elements on their own. A common use case is to
+develop a set of custom styled user interface elements out of the types in the QtQuick module. This is easily
+accomplished by creating your own reusable components.
+
+With the reusable components approach, you define your own type with the appearance you want to have in your
+application and style that type directly. You then use that type in your application instead of the unstyled type. For
+example, you could create a MyText.qml which is a Text element with certain properties set by default, and use MyText
+instead of Text elsewhere in your application.
+
+\section1 Example Themed Text
+\section2 Button Definition
+\snippet qml/usecases/MyText.qml 0
+\section2 Using the Text
+\snippet qml/usecases/styling-text.qml texts
+\image qml-uses-styling-text.png
+
+Because the root item in MyText.qml is a Text item it will behave as a
+Text item, and the properties can be overriden in specific uses. However, the properties will be set to the values
+specified in MyText when the item is first generated, thus applying your style by default.
+
+For pre-styled user interface elements, see the \c{Qt Components} add-on which provides a set of components.
+For accessing the system theme, see the \l{SystemPalette} element documentation.

 \title Use Case - Displaying Text In QML
 \brief Example of how to display text in QML
+To display text the Text type is provided by the QtQuick module. For related uses, the \l{TextInput} and
+\l{TextEdit} types provide editable text controls. For full HTML markup, see the \c{QtWebkit} module.
+
+\section1 Displaying and Formatting Text
+
+To display text in QML, create a Text item and set the text property to the text you wish to display. The Text item
+will now display that text.
+
+Several properties can be set on the Text item to style the entire block of text. These include color, font family,
+font size, bold and italic. For a full list of properties, consult the \l{Text} type documentation.
+
+Rich text like markup can be used to selectively style specific sections of text with a Text item. Set \l
+Text::textFormat to Text.StyledText to use this functionality. More details are available in the documentation of the
+\l{Text} type.
+
+\section1 Laying out Text
+
+By default, Text will display the text as a single line unless it contains embedded newlines. To wrap the line, set the
+wrapMode property and give the text an explicit width for it to wrap to. If the width or height is not explicitly set,
+reading these properties will return the parameters of the bounding rect of the text (if you have explicitly set width
+or height, you can still use paintedWidth and paintedHeight). With these parameters in mind, the Text can be positioned
+like any other Item.

-\brief Example of how to accept user-input and respond to it in a QML application
+\title Use Case - Responding To User Input in QML
+\brief Example of how to accept user input and respond to it in a QML application
+
+\section1 Supported Types of User Input
+
+The \l QtQuick module provides support for the most common types of user input,
+including mouse and touch events, text input and key-press events.  Other
+modules provide support for other types of user input (for example, the
+\l QtSensors module provides support for shake-gestures in QML applications).
+
+This article covers how to handle basic user input; for further information
+about motion-gesture support, please see the \l QtSensors documentation. For
+information about audio-visual input, please see the \l QtMultimedia documentation.
+
+\section2 Mouse and Touch Events
+
+The \l MouseArea type allows mouse and touch events to be handled in a QML
+application.  A \l MouseArea can be combined with either an \l Image or a
+\l Rectangle and \l Text object to implement a simple button.
+
+\snippet qml/usecases/userinput.qml 0
+
+For more advanced use cases requiring multiple touch points, please read the
+documentation for the \l MultiPointTouchArea element and the \l PinchArea element.
+
+Note that some elements have their own built in input handling. For example,
+\l Flickable responds to mouse dragging, mouse wheel scrolling, touch dragging,
+and touch flicking by default.
+
+\section2 Keyboard and Button Events
+
+Button and key presses, from buttons on a device, a keypad, or a keyboard,
+can all be handled using the \l Keys attached property. This attached property
+is available on all \l Item derived elements, and works with the \l Item::focus property
+to determine which element receives the key event. For simple key handling, you can set the focus
+to true on a single \l Item and do all your key handling there.
+
+\snippet qml/usecases/userinput-keys.qml 0
+
+For text input the \l QtQuick module provides several built-in types.
+In particular, the \l TextInput and \l TextEdit types allow for single-line
+entry and multi-line editing respectively.
+
+Here is all you need to get a working TextInput:
+
+\code
+import QtQuick 2.0
+
+TextInput {
+    focus: true
+    text: "Initial Text"
+}
+\endcode
+

 \title Use Case - Visual Elements In QML
 \brief Example of how to display visual item types in a QML application
+
+\section1 The Rectangle Type
+
+For the most basic of visuals, QtQuick provides a \l Rectangle type to draw rectangles. These rectangles can be colored with a
+color or a vertical gradient. The \l Rectangle type can also draw borders on the rectangle.
+
+For drawing custom shapes beyond rectangles, see the \l Canvas type or display
+a pre-rendered image using the \l Image type.
+
+\snippet qml/usecases/visual-rects.qml 0
+\image qml-uses-visual-rectangles.png
+
+\section1 The Image Type
+
+QtQuick provides an \l Image type which may be used to display images.  The
+\l Image type has a \l source property whose value can be a remote or local
+URL, or the URL of an image file embedded in a compiled resource file.
+
+\snippet qml/usecases/visual.qml image
+
+For more complex images there are other types similar to \l Image.
+\l BorderImage draws an image with grid scaling, suitable for images used as
+borders. \l AnimatedImage plays animated .gif and .mng images. \l AnimatedSprite
+and \l SpriteSequence play animations comprised of multiple frames stored adjacently
+in a non animated image format.
+
+For displaying video files and camera data, see the \l QtMultimedia module.
+
+\section1 Shared Visual Properties
+
+All visual items provided by the QtQuick are based on the Item type, which provides a common set of attributes for
+visual items, including opacity and transform attributes.
+
+\section2 Opacity and Visibility
+
+The QML object types provided by Qt Quick have built-in support for \l{Item::opacity}{opacity}.
+Opacity can be animated to allow smooth transitions to or from a transparent
+state. Visibility can also be managed with the \l{Item::visible}{visible} property more efficiently,
+but at the cost of not being able to animate it.
+
+\snippet qml/usecases/visual-opacity.qml 0
+\image qml-uses-visual-opacity.png
+
+\section2 Transforms
+
+Qt Quick types have built-in support for transformations. If you wish to have your
+visual content rotated or scaled, you can set the \l Item::rotation or \l Item::scale
+property. These can also be animated.
+
+\snippet qml/usecases/visual-transforms.qml 0
+\image qml-uses-visual-transforms.png
+
+For more complex transformations, see the \l Item::transform property.
