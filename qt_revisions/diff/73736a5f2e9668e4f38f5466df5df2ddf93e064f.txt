+    \section2 Using a Loader within a view delegate
+
+    In some cases you may wish to use a Loader within a view delegate to improve delegate
+    loading performance. This works well in most cases, but there is one important issue to
+    be aware of related to the \l{QtQuick2::Component#creation-context}{creation context} of a Component.
+
+    In the following example, the \c index context property inserted by the ListView into \c delegateComponent's
+    context will be inaccessible to Text, as the Loader will use the creation context of \c myComponent as the parent
+    context when instantiating it, and \c index does not refer to anything within that context chain.
