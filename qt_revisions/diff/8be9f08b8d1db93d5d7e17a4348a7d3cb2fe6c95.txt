+    \title QtQuick.Particles Examples - Affectors
+    \example particles/affectors
+    \brief This is a collection of examples using Affectors in the QML particle system.
+    \image qml-affectors-example.png
+
+    This is a collection of small QML examples relating to using Affectors in the particle system.
+    Each example is a small QML file emphasizing a particular element or feature.
+
+    Age demonstrates using an Age affector to prematurely end the lives of particles.
+    \snippet examples/particles/affectors/content/age.qml 0
+
+    As you move the affector around the screen, the particles inside it
+    (which haven't already been affected) jump to a period near the end
+    of their life. This gives them a short period to finish fading out,
+    but changing lifeLeft to 0 (the default), would cause them to reach
+    the end of their life instantly.
+
+    Attractor demonstrates using an Attractor affector to simulate a black hole
+    \snippet examples/particles/affectors/content/attractor.qml 0
+
+    All particles in the scene, including the rocket ship's exhaust and pellets, are pulled
+    towards the black hole. This effect is stronger closer to the black hole, so the
+    asteroids near the top of the screen are barely affected at all, while the ones
+    towards the middle sometimes curve drastically. To complete the effect, an Age
+    affector covers the black hole to destroy particles which come in contact with it.
+
+    Custom Affector manipulates the properties of the particles directly in javascript.
+    One Affector is used to make the leaves rock back and forth as they fall, looking more
+    leaf-like than just spinning in circles:
+    \snippet examples/particles/affectors/content/customaffector.qml 0
+    Another is used to provide a slightly varying friction to the leaves as they 'land',
+    to look more natural:
+    \snippet examples/particles/affectors/content/customaffector.qml 1
+
+    Friction is similar to the falling leaves in the custom affector, except that it uses a
+    flat friction the whole way down instead of custom affectors.
+    \snippet examples/particles/affectors/content/friction.qml 0
+
+    Gravity is a convenience affector for applying a constant acceleration to particles inside it
+    \snippet examples/particles/affectors/content/gravity.qml 0
+
+    GroupGoal sets up two particle groups for flaming and non-flaming balls, and gives you various
+    ways to transition between them.
+    \snippet examples/particles/affectors/content/groupgoal.qml unlit
+    The non-flaming balls have a one in a hundred chance of lighting on their own each second, but they also
+    have a GroupGoal set on the whole group. This affector affects all particles of the unlit group, when colliding
+    with particles in the lit group, and cause them to move to the lighting group.
+    \snippet examples/particles/affectors/content/groupgoal.qml lighting
+    lighting is an intermediate group so that the glow builds up and the transition is less jarring. So it automatically
+    moves into the lit group after 100ms.
+    \snippet examples/particles/affectors/content/groupgoal.qml lit
+    The lit group also has TrailEmitters on it for additional fire and smoke, but does not transition anywhere.
+    There are two more GroupGoal elements that allow particles in the unlit group to transition to the lighting group
+    (and then to the lit group).
+    \snippet examples/particles/affectors/content/groupgoal.qml groupgoal-pilot
+    The first is just an area bound to the location of an image of a pilot flame. When unlit balls pass through the flame,
+    they go straight to lit because the pilot flame is so hot.
+    \snippet examples/particles/affectors/content/groupgoal.qml groupgoal-ma
+    The second is bound to the location of the last pointer interaction, so that touching or clicking on unlit balls (which
+    is hard due to their constant movement) causes them to move to the lighting group.
+
+    Move shows some simple effects you can get by altering trajectory midway.
+    The red particles have an affector that affects their position, jumping them forwards by 120px.
+    \snippet examples/particles/affectors/content/move.qml A
+    The green particles have an affector that affects their velocity, but with some angle variation. By adding some random direction
+    velocity to their existing forwards velocity, they begin to spray off in a cone.
+    \snippet examples/particles/affectors/content/move.qml B
+    The blue particles have an affector that affects their acceleration, and because it sets relative to false this resets the acceleration instead of
+    adding to it. Once the blue particles reach the affector, their horizontal velocity stops increasing as their vertical velocity decreases.
+    \snippet examples/particles/affectors/content/move.qml C
+
+    SpriteGoal has an affector which interacts with the sprite engine of particles, if they are being drawn as sprites by ImageParticle.
+    \snippet examples/particles/affectors/content/spritegoal.qml 0
+    The SpriteGoal follows the image of the rocket ship on screen, and when it interacts with particles drawn by ImageParticle as sprites,
+    it instructs them to move immediately to the "explode" state, which in this case is the animation of the asteroid breaking into many pieces.
+
+    Turbulence has a flame with smoke, and both sets of particles being affected by a Turbulence affector. This gives a faint wind effect.
+    \snippet examples/particles/affectors/content/turbulence.qml 0
+    To make the wind change direction, subsitute a black and white noise image in the noiseSource parameter (it currently uses a default noise source).
+
+    Wander uses a Wander affector to add some horizontal drift to snowflakes as they fall down.
+    \snippet examples/particles/affectors/content/wander.qml 0
+    There are different movements given by applying the Wander to different attributes of the trajectory, so the example makes it easy to play around and see the difference.
