-    \example linguist/arrowpad
-    \title Arrow Pad Example
-
-    This example is a slightly more involved and introduces a key \e
-    {Qt Linguist} concept: "contexts". It also shows how to use two
-    or more languages.
-
-    \image linguist-arrowpad_en.png
-
-    We will use two translations, French and Dutch, although there is no
-    effective limit on the number of possible translations that can be used
-    with an application. The relevant lines of \c arrowpad.pro are
-
-    \snippet examples/linguist/arrowpad/arrowpad.pro 0
-    \codeline
-    \snippet examples/linguist/arrowpad/arrowpad.pro 1
-
-    Run \c lupdate; it should produce two identical message files
-    \c arrowpad_fr.ts and \c arrowpad_nl.ts. These files will contain all the source
-    texts marked for translation with \c tr() calls and their contexts.
-
-    See the \l{Qt Linguist manual} for more information about
-    translating Qt application.
-
-    \section1 Line by Line Walkthrough
-
-    In \c arrowpad.h we define the \c ArrowPad subclass which is a
-    subclass of QWidget. In the screenshot above, the central
-    widget with the four buttons is an \c ArrowPad.
-
-    \snippet examples/linguist/arrowpad/arrowpad.h 0
-    \snippet examples/linguist/arrowpad/arrowpad.h 1
-    \snippet examples/linguist/arrowpad/arrowpad.h 2
-
-    When \c lupdate is run it not only extracts the source texts but it
-    also groups them into contexts. A context is the name of the class in
-    which the source text appears. Thus, in this example, "ArrowPad" is a
-    context: it is the context of the texts in the \c ArrowPad class. 
-    The \c Q_OBJECT macro defines \c tr(x) in \c ArrowPad like this:
-
-    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_examples_arrowpad.cpp 0
-
-    Knowing which class each source text appears in enables \e {Qt
-    Linguist} to group texts that are logically related together, e.g.
-    all the text in a dialog will have the context of the dialog's class
-    name and will be shown together. This provides useful information for
-    the translator since the context in which text appears may influence how
-    it should be translated. For some translations keyboard
-    accelerators may need to be changed and having all the source texts in a
-    particular context (class) grouped together makes it easier for the
-    translator to perform any accelerator changes without introducing
-    conflicts.
-
-    In \c arrowpad.cpp we implement the \c ArrowPad class.
-
-    \snippet examples/linguist/arrowpad/arrowpad.cpp 0
-    \snippet examples/linguist/arrowpad/arrowpad.cpp 1
-    \snippet examples/linguist/arrowpad/arrowpad.cpp 2
-    \snippet examples/linguist/arrowpad/arrowpad.cpp 3
-
-    We call \c ArrowPad::tr() for each button's label since the labels are
-    user-visible text.
-
-    \image linguist-arrowpad_en.png
-
-    \snippet examples/linguist/arrowpad/mainwindow.h 0
-    \snippet examples/linguist/arrowpad/mainwindow.h 1
-
-    In the screenshot above, the whole window is a \c MainWindow.
-    This is defined in the \c mainwindow.h header file. Here too, we
-    use \c Q_OBJECT, so that \c MainWindow will become a context in
-    \e {Qt Linguist}.
-
-    \snippet examples/linguist/arrowpad/mainwindow.cpp 0
-
-    In the implementation of \c MainWindow, \c mainwindow.cpp, we create
-    an instance of our \c ArrowPad class.
-
-    \snippet examples/linguist/arrowpad/mainwindow.cpp 1
-
-    We also call \c MainWindow::tr() twice, once for the action and
-    once for the shortcut.
-
-    Note the use of \c tr() to support different keys in other
-    languages. "Ctrl+Q" is a good choice for Quit in English, but a
-    Dutch translator might want to use "Ctrl+A" (for Afsluiten) and a
-    German translator "Strg+E" (for Beenden). When using \c tr() for
-    \uicontrol Ctrl key accelerators, the two argument form should be used
-    with the second argument describing the function that the
-    accelerator performs.
-
-    Our \c main() function is defined in \c main.cpp as usual.
-
-    \snippet examples/linguist/arrowpad/main.cpp 2
-    \snippet examples/linguist/arrowpad/main.cpp 3
-
-    We choose which translation to use according to the current locale.
-    QLocale::system() can be influenced by setting the \c LANG
-    environment variable, for example. Notice that the use of a naming
-    convention that incorporates the locale for \c .qm message files,
-    (and TS files), makes it easy to implement choosing the
-    translation file according to locale.
-
-    If there is no QM message file for the locale chosen the original
-    source text will be used and no error raised.
-
-    \section1 Translating to French and Dutch
-
-    We'll begin by translating the example application into French. Start
-    \e {Qt Linguist} with \c arrowpad_fr.ts. You should get the seven source
-    texts ("\&Up", "\&Left", etc.) grouped in two contexts ("ArrowPad"
-    and "MainWindow").
-
-    Now, enter the following translations:
-
-    \list
-    \li \c ArrowPad
-         \list
-         \li \&Up - \&Haut
-         \li \&Left - \&Gauche
-         \li \&Right - \&Droite
-         \li \&Down - \&Bas
-         \endlist
-    \li \c MainWindow
-         \list
-         \li E\&xit - \&Quitter
-         \li Ctrl+Q - Ctrl+Q
-         \li \&File - \&Fichier
-         \endlist
-    \endlist
-
-    It's quickest to press \uicontrol{Alt+D} (which clicks the \uicontrol {Done \& Next}
-    button) after typing each translation, since this marks the
-    translation as done and moves on to the next source text.
-
-    Save the file and do the same for Dutch working with \c arrowpad_nl.ts:
-
-    \list
-    \li \c ArrowPad
-         \list
-         \li \&Up - \&Omhoog
-         \li \&Left - \&Links
-         \li \&Right - \&Rechts
-         \li \&Down - Omlaa\&g
-         \endlist
-    \li \c MainWindow
-         \list
-         \li E\&xit - \&Afsluiten
-         \li Ctrl+Q - Ctrl+A
-         \li File - \&Bestand
-         \endlist
-    \endlist
-
-    We have to convert the \c tt1_fr.ts and \c tt1_nl.ts translation source
-    files into QM files. We could use \e {Qt Linguist} as we've done
-    before; however using the command line tool \c lrelease ensures that
-    \e all the QM files for the application are created without us
-    having to remember to load and \uicontrol File|Release each one
-    individually from \e {Qt Linguist}.
-
-    Type
-
-    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_examples_arrowpad.qdoc 1
-
-    This should create both \c arrowpad_fr.qm and \c arrowpad_nl.qm. Set the \c
-    LANG environment variable to \c fr. In Unix, one of the two following
-    commands should work
-
-    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_examples_arrowpad.qdoc 2
-
-    In Windows, either modify \c autoexec.bat or run
-
-    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_examples_arrowpad.qdoc 3
-
-    When you run the program, you should now see the French version:
-
-    \image linguist-arrowpad_fr.png
-
-    Try the same with Dutch, by setting \c LANG=nl. Now the Dutch
-    version should appear:
-
-    \image linguist-arrowpad_nl.png
-
-    \section1 Exercises
-
-    Mark one of the translations in \e {Qt Linguist} as not done, i.e.
-    by unchecking the "done" checkbox; run \c lupdate, then \c lrelease,
-    then the example. What effect did this change have?
-
-    Set \c LANG=fr_CA (French Canada) and run the example program again. 
-    Explain why the result is the same as with \c LANG=fr.
-
-    Change one of the accelerators in the Dutch translation to eliminate the
-    conflict between \e \&Bestand and \e \&Boven.

-/*!
-    \example linguist/hellotr
-    \title Hello tr() Example
-
-    This example is a small Hello World program with a Latin translation. The
-    screenshot below shows the English version.
-
-    \image linguist-hellotr_en.png
-
-    See the \l{Qt Linguist manual} for more information about
-    translating Qt application.
-
-    \section1 Line by Line Walkthrough
-
-
-    \snippet examples/linguist/hellotr/main.cpp 0
-
-    This line includes the definition of the QTranslator class. 
-    Objects of this class provide translations for user-visible text.
-
-    \snippet examples/linguist/hellotr/main.cpp 5
-
-    Creates a QTranslator object without a parent.
-
-    \snippet examples/linguist/hellotr/main.cpp 6
-
-    Tries to load a file called \c hellotr_la.qm (the \c .qm file extension is
-    implicit) that contains Latin translations for the source texts used in
-    the program. No error will occur if the file is not found.
-
-    \snippet examples/linguist/hellotr/main.cpp 7
-
-    Adds the translations from \c hellotr_la.qm to the pool of translations used
-    by the program.
-
-    \snippet examples/linguist/hellotr/main.cpp 8
-
-    Creates a push button that displays "Hello world!". If \c hellotr_la.qm
-    was found and contains a translation for "Hello world!", the
-    translation appears; if not, the source text appears.
-
-    All classes that inherit QObject have a \c tr() function. Inside
-    a member function of a QObject class, we simply write \c tr("Hello
-    world!") instead of \c QPushButton::tr("Hello world!") or \c
-    QObject::tr("Hello world!").
-
-    \section1 Running the Application in English
-
-    Since we haven't made the translation file \c hellotr_la.qm, the source text
-    is shown when we run the application:
-
-    \image linguist-hellotr_en.png
-
-    \section1 Creating a Latin Message File
-
-    The first step is to create a project file, \c hellotr.pro, that lists
-    all the source files for the project. The project file can be a qmake
-    project file, or even an ordinary makefile. Any file that contains
-
-    \snippet examples/linguist/hellotr/hellotr.pro 0
-    \snippet examples/linguist/hellotr/hellotr.pro 1
-
-    will work. \c TRANSLATIONS specifies the message files we want to
-    maintain. In this example, we just maintain one set of translations,
-    namely Latin.
-
-    Note that the file extension is \c .ts, not \c .qm. The \c .ts
-    translation source format is designed for use during the
-    application's development. Programmers or release managers run
-    the \c lupdate program to generate and update TS files with
-    the source text that is extracted from the source code.
-    Translators read and update the TS files using \e {Qt
-    Linguist} adding and editing their translations.
-
-    The TS format is human-readable XML that can be emailed directly
-    and is easy to put under version control. If you edit this file
-    manually, be aware that the default encoding for XML is UTF-8, not
-    Latin1 (ISO 8859-1). One way to type in a Latin1 character such as
-    '\oslash' (Norwegian o with slash) is to use an XML entity:
-    "\&#xf8;". This will work for any Unicode 4.0 character.
-
-    Once the translations are complete the \c lrelease program is used to
-    convert the TS files into the QM Qt message file format. The
-    QM format is a compact binary format designed to deliver very
-    fast lookup performance. Both \c lupdate and \c lrelease read all the
-    project's source and header files (as specified in the HEADERS and
-    SOURCES lines of the project file) and extract the strings that
-    appear in \c tr() function calls.
-
-    \c lupdate is used to create and update the message files (\c hellotr_la.ts
-    in this case) to keep them in sync with the source code. It is safe to
-    run \c lupdate at any time, as \c lupdate does not remove any
-    information. For example, you can put it in the makefile, so the TS
-    files are updated whenever the source changes.
-
-    Try running \c lupdate right now, like this:
-
-    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_examples_hellotr.qdoc 0
-
-    (The \c -verbose option instructs \c lupdate to display messages that
-    explain what it is doing.) You should now have a file \c hellotr_la.ts in
-    the current directory, containing this:
-
-    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_examples_hellotr.qdoc 1
-
-    You don't need to understand the file format since it is read and
-    updated using tools (\c lupdate, \e {Qt Linguist}, \c lrelease).
-
-    \section1 Translating to Latin with Qt Linguist
-
-    We will use \e {Qt Linguist} to provide the translation, although
-    you can use any XML or plain text editor to enter a translation into a
-    TS file.
-
-    To start \e {Qt Linguist}, type
-
-    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_examples_hellotr.qdoc 2
-
-    You should now see the text "QPushButton" in the top left pane.
-    Double-click it, then click on "Hello world!" and enter "Orbis, te
-    saluto!" in the \uicontrol Translation pane (the middle right of the
-    window). Don't forget the exclamation mark!
-
-    Click the \uicontrol Done checkbox and choose \uicontrol File|Save from the
-    menu bar. The TS file will no longer contain
-
-    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_examples_hellotr.qdoc 3
-
-    but instead will have
-
-    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_examples_hellotr.qdoc 4
-
-    \section1 Running the Application in Latin
-
-    To see the application running in Latin, we have to generate a QM
-    file from the TS file. Generating a QM file can be achieved
-    either from within \e {Qt Linguist} (for a single TS file), or
-    by using the command line program \c lrelease which will produce one
-    QM file for each of the TS files listed in the project file.
-    Generate \c hellotr_la.qm from \c hellotr_la.ts by choosing
-    \uicontrol File|Release from \e {Qt Linguist}'s menu bar and pressing
-    \uicontrol Save in the file save dialog that pops up. Now run the \c hellotr
-    program again. This time the button will be labelled "Orbis, te
-    saluto!".
