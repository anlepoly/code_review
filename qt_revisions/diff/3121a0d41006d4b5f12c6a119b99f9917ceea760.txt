     This element provides a validator for non-integer numbers.
+
+    Input is accepted if it contains a double that is within the valid range
+    and is in the  correct format.
+
+    Input is accepected but invalid if it contains a double that is outside
+    the range or is in the wrong format; e.g. with too many digits after the
+    decimal point or is empty.
+
+    Input is rejected if it is not a double.
+
+    Note: If the valid range consists of just positive doubles (e.g. 0.0 to
+    100.0) and input is a negative double then it is rejected. If \l notation
+    is set to DoubleValidator.StandardNotation, and  the input contains more
+    digits before the decimal point than a double in the valid range may have,
+    it is also rejected. If \l notation is DoubleValidator.ScientificNotation,
+    and the input is not in the valid range, it is accecpted but invalid. The
+    value may yet become valid by changing the exponent.
