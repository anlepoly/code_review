+    \example qtquick/threading
+    \brief This is a collection of QML Multithreading examples.
+    \image qml-threading-example.png
+
+    Threaded ListModel contains a ListView and a ListModel. The ListModel is updated asynchronusly in another thread, and the results propagate back to the main thread.
+
+    WorkerScript contains an example of using a WorkerScript to offload expensive calculations into another thread. This keeps the UI from being blocked. This example calculates numbers in Pascal's Triangle, and not in a very optimal way, so it will often take several seconds to complete the calculation. By doing this in a WorkerScript in another thread, the UI is not blocked during this time.
