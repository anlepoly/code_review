+  Returns the raw, unfiltered positions for the touch point. The positions are in native screen coordinates.
   To get local coordinates you can use mapFromGlobal() of the QWindow returned by QTouchEvent::window().
 
   \note Returns an empty list if the touch device's capabilities do not include QTouchDevice::RawPositions.
 
+  \note Native screen coordinates refer to the native orientation of the screen which, in case of
+  mobile devices, is typically portrait. This means that on systems capable of screen orientation
+  changes the positions in this list will not reflect the current orientation (unlike pos(),
+  screenPos(), etc.) and will always be reported in the native orientation.
