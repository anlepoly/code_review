+# qmake configuration for the Tegra2 boards.
+#
+# This mkspec is based and tested on the TrimSlice using "Ubuntu Natty (11.04) - l4t.r15.01"-release.
+# It might work with other boards and releases as well.
+# A typical configure line looks like this:
+# <path-to-qt-src>/configure -opensource -confirm-license -make libs -prefix /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt5-tegra2
+# -device tegra2 -device-option CROSS_COMPILE=<path-to-crosstoolchain>/bin/arm-none-linux-gnueabi- \
+# -sysroot <path-to-rootfs> -no-neon
+
+# CAUTION: The Tegra2 chips don't support neon, make sure it will not be used (-no-neon)
