+    \a title is the text which is displayed in the title bar of the dialog.
+    \a label is the text which is shown to the user (it should say what should
+    be entered).
+    \a value is the default integer which the spinbox will be set to.
+    \a min and \a max are the minimum and maximum values the user may choose.
+    \a step is the amount by which the values change as the user presses the
+    arrow buttons to increment or decrement the value.
+
+    If \a ok is nonnull *\a ok will be set to true if the user pressed \uicontrol OK
+    and to false if the user pressed \uicontrol Cancel. The dialog's parent is
+    \a parent. The dialog will be modal and uses the widget \a flags.
+
+    On success, this function returns the integer which has been entered by the
+    user; on failure, it returns the initial \a value.
